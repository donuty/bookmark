  > A way for bibliophiles to index book reviews by author from The New York Times archives.

## Summary ##
  > If you love authors, books, the New York Times, book reviews, and no-fuss, sorbet-colored lists, then Bookmark can keep track of all your future to-reads.

## Problem ##
  > We all have books from the authors we love that we hear about and really want to read... but who can remember them later?  Bookmark can help.

## Solution ##
  > Search the NYT for book reviews by author name and Bookmark will add all of their books to your list.  You can delete the ones you've read/don't want to read, and you can mark each book as read as you go!

## Quote from You ##
  > A list in time saves nine hours of head scratching.  Never have to scratch your head about what your next book is again.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Simply search an author to find their reviews of the specific or a related book in the New York Times.  Then click save, and you'll have it in your list.

## Customer Quote ##
  > 'What could be better than a list of books from authors I want to read, plus a link to the book review in the New York Times?'
